# NYUSH_Foodhunter
Android App for events with food around NYU and NYUSH.

This is a personal project developed for one purpose: getting free food! For most college students, it is essential to save money, and one way to do that is to get free food from on campus events. If you're paying for college, might as well get what you can from school events!

The application was developed in Java for Android. We grab information from the universities' events website using their API. Then, we filter for the keywords that are important (pizza, cookies, refreshments, salads, sandwiches, and so on). We grab a list of the events that contain those keywords and display them on the UI. It shows the time and place of the event, and more importantly, you can RSVP and share this event with your friends through your favorite messaging app or your email.
